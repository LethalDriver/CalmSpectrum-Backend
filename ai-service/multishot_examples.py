Person1: Python has the worst package manager I've worked with, IMO.
Person2: Npm?
Person3: What's so bad about npm?
Person2: I used npx CRA yesterday, and three errors popped up on a stable version.
Person1: I also have no clue what problem Anaconda is supposed to solve, because from my experience, it's even more complicated than venv.
Person3: Well, you're answering your own question.
Person3: Just don't use CRA.
Person3: Vite.
Person3: npm create vite@latest
Person4: Agreed, Vite is better.
Person3: Even the official React documentation now prefers Vite over CRA.
Person2: Oh, cool.
Person2: Thanks.
Person5: C++ is watching.
Person3: Alright, you win.
Person1: I've never written in C++.

Person1: Heya, we had an idea to have all our favorite non-locals to stay together in an Airbnb. Friday to Saturday at least. Parents would be hosted (if possible) or stay in a hotel. Who would be up to having an Airbnb for the group? Leave a like on this :)
Person2: Well, if there are no other options available, we can do that.
Person2: I heard we were supposed to look for something.
Person2: Not sure though.
Person3: That's what we're doing right here, Person2.
Person1: What is Person4's real contact? Can someone add it, please? We are only missing Person4's and Person5's votes.
Person6: Anyway, what is the alternative? Sleeping under a bridge somewhere?
Person7: By the way, I'll be taking my partner too, so you can count me for 2 people.
Person1: Finding your own place. Which is okay as well. This option was just a thought, a fun idea to have all at the same place.
Person1: Anyone else bringing a partner we should include in the Airbnb? Parents would stay separately.
Person1: Hey, since everyone here seems okay with the idea, we would need to know if you all want a shared Airbnb from Friday to Sunday or just Saturday to Sunday?
Person7: We are flying on Friday, so we would need a place to sleep already then.
Person6: And we have a flight back on Tuesday.
Person1: Since people have different flights, I don't think it works to have one big Airbnb for that many nights.
Person6: So then we should find our own place for Sunday-Tuesday?
Person1: I am thinking so at the moment, but if most of you are staying till Tuesday, you could stay in the Airbnb too. Just might be a more costly option.
Person8: Person1, could you make a sheet and see what the prices would be for us staying all together in an Airbnb versus in a hotel?
Person9: I think most people are flying back on Tuesday?
Person7: Maybe let's make a poll and see what days we all need sleeping arrangements for.

Person1: Person2 Person3, would you be able to meet up tomorrow at 12pm? We will sign the papers and discuss the details with Person4.
Person3: Tomorrow I have only remote.
Person1: The location is rather arbitrary, I think. Maybe @Person4, where would it suit you best?
Person4: It can be somewhere in the city center.
Person4: If tomorrow is not good for you, we can meet another day.
Person4: For example, on Thursday.
Person4: Or Wednesday or Friday till 10:30.
Person4: Because later I have work 11-19 on those days.
Person1: So maybe I will send you a form to set up a meeting time.
Person3: Person2, maybe Thursday before billiards or Friday in the morning?
Person3: So I don't have to go just for it to the city because it takes me a lot of time to commute.
Person2: On Friday I am in another country.
Person2: Thursday evening you mean?
Person3: Yup.

Person1: If somebody doesn't have any plans for New Year's Eve, then it will be done in Lublin. Regards.
Person1: You can bring an accompanying person.

Person5: You want to get hit in the ass.
Person5: I guess.
Person5: You avoid everything.
Person5: :(
Person1: Nobody was even expecting you; you were invited out of politeness.
Person4: Two jobs are like that.
Person5: I would be more than happy to exchange two jobs for studies, internship, weekend work for 21-23h.
Person5: At least I will earn money.
Person4: I'm not interested in volunteering.
Person4: XDDD.
Person4: Nah, you will just have less time to spend money.
Person4: For example, I don't have time to go out anywhere.
Person4: Do you know how much money I have left at the end of the month?
Person4: At minimum, 3 PLN per month.
Person1: If somebody knows for sure they won't be coming, then leave the chat.
Person1: Excluding Person4. You can stay.
Person6: If I don't know, then what should I do?
Person7: Same.
Person1: I wrote that those who will definitely not be there should leave, you idiot.
Person5: I'm also not interested in volunteering, but a paper, and I remind you that my internship at such a prestigious Catholic campus is hard work for free, especially with my major (cool dude, only about 300h).
Person5: I was working around 200h per month, and somehow there was no trace of the money in the bank account until the next 10x.
Person5: I don't believe that somebody might not have time to spend money.
Person5: How much do you earn, 240?
Person4: It depends on the month. In the winter, you do the least with animals, so maybe less than 240.
Person5: This is at your parents' farm?
Person4: Yup.
Person5: How much would I give to get up in the morning again at 5am for harvest, then at 8/9 to animals, and at 14 to normal work.
Person5: Even if there was a period when you couldn't even sit down, at least it was so pleasant in the evenings.
Person5: Just sit down and drink some compote.
Person5: Or tinctures.
Person4: Maybe at the end of next year, there will be a full-time job (if I die there). I invite you.
Person5: You can buy me with whatever you want. I can even help for free.
Person5: What do you have besides rabbits?
Person4: Goat, almost, geese, ducks, pheasants, parrots. Next year, there will probably be alpacas and Scotch cows.
Person4: And cats.
Person4: And a dog.
Person4: But it was normal enough that I didn't have to mention that.
Person5: It's so nice to deal with.
Person4: Apart from the geese.
Person4: They are so annoying.
Person4: I mean, since they have seen how I murdered their family and children, they kinda don't like me.
Person4: I don't know why.
Person5: It depends on the geese's character.
Person5: I had really nice ones.
Person5: I could wear them.
